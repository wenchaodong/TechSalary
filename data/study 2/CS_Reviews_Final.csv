The food is good. A fun place to work.The security staff is nice, and some will become good friends.ConsThe datacenter never has enough tools.You feel completely alone and it seems that you shouldn't ask questions once you're let loose post-trainig.I broke down crying a few times on the datacenter floor because I couldn't find any answers or documentation from their intranet or from other employees.They want a phd level of intelligence to work for 20$/hr.Atlanta is the neglected ""redheaded stepchild"" data center.Can be somewhat political, but if you don't get involved with or discuss politics anywhere on memegen or on the internal mailing lists or if you're smart enough to be engage in a neutral manner or pretend to side with the ""correct"" politics rather than your own political beliefs, you'll be alright.I sweat a lot, and no one told me that I could bring spill-proof tumblers or clear drink containers on the DC floor!The training was excellent. But safety protocols conflict with the speed that repairs MUST be accomplished. Eg: you must take shortcuts, like not wear globes when doing battery swaps, even if it's not safe.

You get none of the benefits that regular employees get.  Hourly pay may be equal but no stocks or bonuses obviously.  You don't get to participate in group activities.  Keep in mind you are not one of them, you're a short timer (< 1yr contract).  No prospect for conversion either.  Do it for the money and your resume.  BTW, Google doesn't like it when you say on your resume you worked there even if you are neck deep in a Google project and working/sitting with Google co-workers.

Do note:  on average, the engineers there are merely above average.  Lots of greatness there, but also a lot of embarrassing code.Their promotion of tech leaders to management has a siginficant drawback, in that these two skills are extremely different.

However, I'd much rather give up all my perks for the opportunity to work from home instead.* Was very frustrating from the perspective of an employee of a startup that was acquired.  After getting acquired, all the state-of-the-art competitive software had to be re-written to fit Google's standards: coding style, build tools, and software libraries and protocols.  This felt the opposite of freedom.  Also, it was super hard even getting our first code checked into the monolithic codebase, as no one in the company had ""readability"" in any programming languages.  As such, we had to hire folks from other parts of Google, as well as get ""buddies"" within Google to help review our code.  More handcuffs...* Mostly young workforce, with many from privileged backgrounds, with highly materialistic wants.  ""Smart"" gets thrown around a lot.  There are many smart people, and also many weird characters.  As someone who came in through an acquisition, I increasingly felt that I just didn't belong there, as I'd skipped the entire interview process.* A very stable build system and well-written tech stack, at the cost of severe NIH, overall developmental slowness, and very outdated tech.  No opportunity to code with React.js, a very dominant framework used outside of Google (competing with Angular 2)* Frontend developers are not really taken seriously.  JavaScript is barely tolerated as a ""real language"" and the tech stack and build tools were completely disparate from the real world.",3.0

I had the opportunity to work on many different projects. One of the very first issues I had was I came up with a new platform design, taught myself auto-cad and created a working 3D model. Submitted an official proposal to have it reviewed. Ended up speaking with some of the heads of the design department but they said there were already too many irons in the fire and we'd have to revisit it later.

Contractors are treated differently in terms of security and processing.  It took weeks to get my credentials figured out so I could use email and to use the build system.  Security is tight there, and slow.  My access to the building took two or more weeks to clear.  I was not able to access all of the code I needed to do my job.The worst part is that contractors are treated as a security risk, so they get no heads up when there services are no longer needed.  Just a simple ""this is your last day.  Clean up your desk, leave your computer, and head out.""

I would be told something by someone on my team who heard it in passing from our manager, and then the exact opposite would happen in two weeks. Even when that manager quit, the same things kept happening, and even when I switched teams (within the same department), so I believe the entire department was rotting from the head.I saw excessive amounts of waste at every turn. Corporate culture is one of laziness and complacency, to the point where trying to pick up extra work that is technically beyond the scope of your job title will actually penalize you. I had to argue for weeks to convince a senior engineer to make a one line, basic change to top of rack switch because he simply didn't want to do it, and there was literally no recourse for me (I quit before he did, if he ever did).There are also some really sketchy activity going on inside, and attempts at bringing said activity to light will most likely only end poorly for you.Overall, it started off great when I was still enamored by the name ""Google"" and was but a lowly peon. But as my team members quickly quit and my responsibilities expanded to encompass their old duties (because hiring for your team is also a nightmare), I saw more and more of the grit beneath the glamor.

During my first few months at Google I learned a ton from internal resources and learning about their technical infrastructure.+ Overall good culture of transparency, giving voice to employees, and trying to make sure employees are happy.+ Good compensation.Cons:Google is huge, and this has a number of consequences. For one, many engineering teams move very slowly. Lots of red tape, and lots of huge systems to integrate with. Very deep management chains. For an individual contributor, decisions may be made many levels above you and you have very little input or context.Depending on the team, it can be hard to have meaningful impact at Google. Some systems are so old they are already fully optimized, others are just so large that you're unlikely to touch more than a small piece or sub system.

Following that, I worked in San Bruno on the YouTube Red project.  It was extremely annoying and we were treated poorly.  At YouTube our supervisor was terrible.  I can honestly say she was the worst manager I've ever worked for.  Blamed us for her lack of procedure and disorganization.  Instead of real coding (and Graphics as promised) we spent our days and sometimes nights trying to modify an often broken and bizarre script-based system.

Super stressful.,"Like many people, I accepted a job at Amazon because COVID caused my previous employer to almost go under and to do mass layoffs. Amazon has been grabbing up a lot of talent that left these smaller companies during the pandemic, since they're in such a good position to benefit financially from all of it.The reality though? Amazon's rapid shift to allowing almost everyone to work from home meant they had to re-purpose all of the ""local I.T."" staff as phone and chat help desk people. The current thinking in the company is that they'll never go back to the old business model of in person walk up support for computer issues. That's had a lot of side effects, including essentially dismantling the former audio-visual department and trying to cross-train them on I.T. support while I.T. learns how to do their jobs.It feels like procedures and processes change almost weekly, so you're often expected to review document daily at the start of your shift doing support, in case they changed something critical to how you provide that support. Combined with so many proprietary support tools (because Amazon really likes to build its own solutions rather than adopting industry standards sold by competitors), it can literally make one's head hurt trying to get a handle on everything and keep up with it.  Meanwhile, the ""numbers"" people are constantly adopting more ""metrics"" and rules they want to apply to maximize efficiency.If you're someone who was only looking for a dead-end help-desk job to do for a year or two, Amazon might seem tempting.

Though the company is clear in the direction they want things to go with their open door policies and open collaborative management styles; Some poor decision still find ways to get management positions there. Once I discovered my biggest barrier for advancement was the manager I reported to, my work started to decline as I was getting more focused on finding that next step in career growth outside the company. I recommend Amazon as a company to work for but, warn anyone that finds themselves in a position of being micromanaged. Micromanagement is not what amazon is about and unfortunately the only way for these types of managers to get noticed is when those working under them began leaving. The risks people (self included) take when dropping under a poor manager are not worth it. As was my case: I was readying my resignation and was focused on trying to make everything appear correctly, this distraction caused me to error on a LOTO procedure that made my resignation irrelevant. Prior to that final manager, I had a lot of great experiences with a long list of managers that are still with the company.

Between manager and engineer, the emphasis is on delivering results while at the same time raising the bar.Like most corporate cultures, there is some level of hypocrisy that one has to live with. The important thing is to retain your values by not co-opting into it.The compensation is generous, and I have no complaints.Most of the day's work is focused on moving the needle on your sprint tasks. Code reviews, scrum meetings, mentoring, design reviews, keeping abreast of latest technologies, dev-ops tasks and on-call work have all to be squeezed in.

Upon completion of this investigation a came to work one morning to find all my belongings thrown all over the floor.  I was evicted from my work area without notice and was excepted to clean it all up.  I told my managers manager “I’m will not”, and the trash stayed on the floor for two years.

We were all encouraged to leave work at a reasonable hour (though non-interns had regularly-scheduled on-call rotations).However, I know of a handful of people who got stuck working on less good teams, which included problems like unclear expectations, toxic competition between teammates, and favoritism. This wouldn't be a big deal (since it isn't very frequent in the grand scheme of things), except that when it happens, there is little recourse. Amazon believes in a flat structure, leaving individual teams completely in charge of their domains. This is great when the teams are well-managed; things move quickly and efficiently.

When you're on a well managed team, you'll solve complex problems and be actively challenged daily, and the culture respects your growth as an expert.If you get a poor manager, your life can be much worse; Amazonian engineers are generally all on a rotation for 24/7 on-call, you'll carry a pager, and a lot of managers fail to account for Ops burden in your time to complete your normal tasks.

Change is good but to much change can be bad.  Especially if communication is not something the teams are good at.  At Amazon there is always multiple projects going on at the same time and teams stepping on another teams project is a common occurrence in the pursuit of process improvement.  It was said multiple times during my employment with Amazon that it was not a company to retire from.  Rather it was a company to build your experience and move up or move on.  I could go on and on.

There are so many folks like me who once they leave Amazon find every other company lacking -- lacking in their passion for customers, lacking in their focus, lacking in their discipline, and lacking in their professionalism.  I know dozens of people who have worked there 2-3 times.  Sometimes 9 months at a time, sometimes 2 years at a stretch.There is hands down no company that knows how to do it better.  It isn't without its flaws.  Amazon has a tolerance for ""jerks"" for developers.  I didn't see any ""jerk"" managers.  Very smart, but they are such prima donnas that the friction they cause offsets their intelligence.  IMO, last time I was there, I was under the clear impression that Amazon is aware of the cost of the jerks and is evolving away, but still struggles a little with recognizing that tolerance for jerks is an anachronistic way to look at the world.I don't think Amazon is an unfair environment.

919,No backlash for terrible managers,Software Development Engineer(Former Employee),"Corporate culture is good, smarter people than the typical company",Direct managers are often incompetent but still trusted implicitly,"Amazon has a fantastic set of core values that they adhere to better than most companies. Their consumer obsession has meant that they are growing at a geometric rate and that's really the problem. The front-line management is almost entirely made of developers who have no idea how to use basic management tools (Gantt charts, burndowns, etc...) and still fundamentally believe they are devs. That means when influences come from outside, the front-line management is unwilling to listen to them and blames any change in the team culture for their own failures. There seem to be no repercussion for this as there is a tacit assumption that understanding the corporate culture makes a person inherently right.The successful projects are lead by the veteran managers (5+ years as managers) and senior engineers, the failures are led by the recent converts (<2 years as managers). The biggest lesson is that Amazon isn't somehow special, the same politics and petty infighting still happens. Your happiness will be determined by the project you are on and the direct manager you work for; no one and nothing will prevent the same kind of drudgery at any other company.",2.0

After a big release (like a Kindle or Kindle Fire), you will either be recognized as ""great"" or ""causal"" to the success.  Worse, as a manager, you will be told how you should rate your team.1st Year Reviews are always the hardest because you realize if someone on your team was a ""rockstar"" that you really can't give more rewards than the ""average guy"" because of the current rate of stock options.

It's all sticks.And when you do a great job and get 10 miracles done in 2 day they will throw 10 more insane tasks at you to get done in 2 or 3 days.Because everyone is so over tasked it's extremely hard to get others time for background help.I would only say that the pay was good and there are really smart people there.But the turn-over is the worst I've ever seen.  I've been there 6 months and 6 people have left and gone in my group.  4 have come and left in that very short period of time.

They clearly put NO value in there employees.There's nice people to work with... those are the miserable ones generally...  and there's complete ruthless task masters.I had 3 managers for just me... one developer.  Usually it's the other way around and you will have 3 developers for one manager.  But for me it was reversed.  Just bad management if you ask me.I finally pushed back to get more developers and they got an intern.So little investment in developers in my opinion.You will quickly go from 40 to 45 to 50 hours in no time.

The atmosphere you get as a contractor is very competitive and management definitely has favorites, thus there is a lot of politics. However, there is hardly any micromanagement, which leaves a lot of flexibility with scheduling and without the feeling of someone always looking over your shoulder. Advancement is pretty challenging as a contractor since they generally hire you with the intent for you as a temp - nothing more. This makes its hard to go into the company and then move up the corporate ladder. As contractor, your work life balance is pretty good. You get your 8 hours in and you're out.

Most of your experience is very team dependent, and mine is a very poor experience. My role is on a low-code/no-code team, which is very frustrating as a Software Engineer. The tools we use and the way we use them, for the most part, don't require Software Engineers or technical employees, so I am bored and my potential is wasted here. On the bright side, work-life balance is still ok, and my teammates are nice enough. This is very specific to my team, though.I believe I was also under-leveled when I joined Microsoft. At my previous company, I was doing Software Engineer II level work, but that level was titled just Software Engineer. In addition, I'm not great at interviews, but I am a great employee. I've found it very difficult so far when looking at other teams to get them to consider me for SWE II positions (even before interviewing) because I'm SWE I and that's just not how it's done here.As a whole, Microsoft has amazing benefits that are hard to match. It's such a huge company that there are so many different avenues to explore, but it also feels really difficult and overwhelming to explore those avenues and discover if Microsoft has something that you're truly interested in.",3.0

Coworkers respect your time. They are generally kind and helpful. Management has been pretty reasonable overall.The problem is that the work is so dull. I think I got a bad team, but I am just constantly bored. I have no desire to do anything, fix anything, or continue working. This is not true of all teams, but it is true of mine. The big problem is that testing any change is absurdly difficult. It can take days to do the most basic smoke test of any change, and people just seem ok with that. I genuinely don't understand. Our product is complicated, but it's not like we can't create working development environments that allow us to test this stuff.

Great work/life balance, got along great with everyone on my team and even made some great friends, extremely supportive of growth, only downside was that the mission of the team was constantly changing and it was hard to work towards long-term goals, but the environment was so enjoyable it wasn't of huge concern. After a reorg, I changed teams. This happened close to the start of pandemic remote work, and I moved to a slightly different time zone. Work on this team has been grueling, with non-existent work/life balance and very little support from other team members.Overall, my situation likely does not apply if you remain on the same time zone as your team, but the team you are on will definitely make a significant difference in your experience here.",3.0

I regularly had to learn new internal tools which had little to no documentation, were buggy to the point of being unusable, and the authors either were gone, in another timezone, had limited English, or some combination of those.Getting anything done was challenge.

The company is still riven with internal rivalries and competition though. Some teams work well, others less well. A lot of old-school management around who can poison things - stabbing everyone in the back and doing anything to get ahead / stay ahead.The rewards policy is good, when it works, but in technical field roles visibility is everything: people who brown-nose senior management and jump up and down undertaking (often pointless) internal activities that shout ""look at me"" at every possible juncture will always get ahead at the expense of people who work hard, hit their targets and deliver customer outcomes.  Everything is about ""impact"" which translates to ""internal emails my skip manager saw my name attached to""; not happy customers, successful project delivery or numbers.Constant internal re-shuffling means your job is never really safe, but in the technical teams mostly people seem to find roles elsewhere in the company when the axe falls. Work life balance is very good, lots of flexibility and understanding. Encouragement to learn and development is good too.

On top of that, managed service and contract employees, especially in test, are not often given the chance or consideration for FTE positions even when performing the same job.

Which is a crime since my team was hired to support bigger customers moving to or trying to move to Azure and AzureAD. The two weeks of training consisted of two full time support engineers (one the first week, the other the second) reading a 50+ slide PowerPoint deck to new hires in Las Colinas and North Carolina. This was the most disappointing part of my time at Microsoft.There was little help from full-time engineers and the actual behind the scenes support of customers was often sophomoric.

Buildings are pleasing, your beverage intake needs are met, from teas, coffees, sodas, coconut milk etc.. cost free.One thing that really makes me excited to work at Microsoft is that they are continuously evolving. There is no ""standard procedure"". Those are thrown out the window ever couple of months with re-orgs and re-focusing. Microsoft invents the next ""standard procedure"" and moves on to better ideas in empowering it's developers. If you're use to business as usual approach that some companies use, diving into a company's culture like Microsoft can either be invigorating, or leave you grasping for some sense of normalcy in your day to day. But, that's the idea behind a growth mind set.Personally, I'm not a big fan of open spaces that Microsoft is moving towards. Either you love it or hate it. Collaboration has improved dramatically and all your peers, managers, skip levels are all easily accessibly right across the room from you.

1309,Smart people but company culture discourages collaboration outside the team,Software Engineer(Former Employee),,,"The company culture encourages protecting yourself by avoiding any work that is not directly assigned by your manager, because any delay in your work will affect your review from your manager. Everyone also values time alone, often closing their offices and making themselves unavailable through emails and instant messages. It can be difficult to get buy-in on a project from other teams, even for small things like code reviews or short meetings. Additionally, the PMs responsible for handling these kinds of issues routinely leave the company or move to different departments.There is very little cross-team knowledge-sharing. Even within the same team, until you are sent a code review, you rarely know much detail about what your teammates are working on.The company is full of smart engineers who produce good work, but there is a collective resignation to the mountains of legacy code that will always be a thorn in their sides. No one is interested in improving the situation, because all of their assigned work is feature work and they don't have the time.There was a surprising lack of developer tools (aside from the standard public-facing tools like Visual Studio and TFS), with essentially no standardization across the company. Every team had their own ways of building, deploying, and monitoring code. However, this did improve noticeably during my time at Microsoft, with a new company build platform and some standardization of source control, code reviews, and pre-checkin testing.",3.0

Coming from a waterfall model (operating systems), you have to be very organized under agile and have a lot of different pieces of relevant knowledge in working memory at one time.Also, when you dump a manager, and then get put under him again -- it's strange. This does happen -- and in theory it should all be objective -- but who knows?Also, it was very hard to transfer across divisions. So a perceived foot in the Microsoft door into a division that was hiring a lot, but that you did not really want, may leave you stuck there. Or worse.The salary and benefits were great.",4.0

Although, the general slow operational pace of Microsoft can sometimes be frustrating the most enjoyable part is the volume and span of impact that each product/feature/change release can make.If someone is passionate about enterprise scale product/service, likes working on wide range technologies and is comfortable with slower pace of change release then Microsoft is a great company to work for.",4.0

My first 8 years at Microsoft I had wonderful managers, and the job was great, a whole team working hard together and really caring about the product we put out.At some point after several re-orgs our team got relocated under a very toxic management chain, people who'd worked for microsoft for over 20 years were quitting or getting laid off.   I wound up in a management chain of career climbers who didn't care as much about the customers as they did abour producing metrics to get themselves raises and promotions.   That really made the job miserable.  Plus the HR department at Microsoft is terrible.  Terrible policies, and clearly no understanding of how quality work gets done.  They were almost as much to blame for the  poor work environment as the toxic management.

However, after the acquisition, the focus quickly changed from helping others to selling software and making as much money as possible. In my opinion, success doesn't come from making empty promises and pushing software on clients. It comes from being genuine in your desire to help them and then delivering what you say you will deliver.",3.0

I cannot stress this enough, the work itself was almost entirely meaningless, and they knew it. The emphasis was on projecting the illusion to higher leadership that the org was useful and worthy of additional resources.Information provided during the hiring process (including job responsibilities and potential transfer, advancement, and location options) proved to be untrue. Management had no shame when it came to establishing unrealistic expectations and could quickly devolve into pettiness if called out for it. Honest feedback was never welcomed, only compliance. We were expected to smile and be pleasant at all times, regardless of how much unimpactful work was heaped upon us (and often demanded urgently). I was told at one point ""this is tech, where everyone fakes it until they make it,"" which I found disgusting and untrue. Tech did not get to where it is today by only pretending to offer value.The horrible performance review process required employees and managers to rate one another (not anonymously), and a certain number of workers were required to fail, regardless of performance. The managers would formally gather to argue over which employees could meet expectations, which equated to rewarding employees with a reputation for being smiley and compliant.

Lots of ego and toxic bully behavior triggered by their stack ranking performance evaluations so everyone is competing against peers. They literally encourage people to talk behind people's backs (it's called providing peer feedback). Sometimes it goes out of hand because management sucks on average. They promote people with zero people skills, zero problem solving skills, zero team building skills and empathy to managers. Really, it takes more than taking your team out for lunch once in a while to call yourself a manager.Diversity is a PR stunt only - they hire you for the stats, they boast about their diversity programs all while don't care about retention rates (they keep those secret). They really are a white-boys-under-25 club. I heard reports of people doing drugs to outperform peers and win the rat race towards a raise.

Working from home.,"Scheduling is awful, long hours, management, cult like behavior.","First I would like to start by pointing out some of the few goods there are. The benefits starts (almost) immediately, and you do get to work from home and depending on what your commute would have been you could possibly be saving on gas and vehicle wear and tear.Since the AHA position like other positions at apple are based around retail hours and customer need expect to work long hours with scheduling that doesn't make any sense. If you have a hobby outside of work you can forget about it. They say you if you provide these excellent metric numbers you can have whatever schedule you want but trying to get it may prove to be an impossible task. Your call score or metrics are also based around the very same people you take calls from. Imagine helping someone who's been on the phone for an hour only to fix their problem, you bid them farewell and move on only to have them still give you a low score but not based on the work you did but the customers outlook on apple.Call time is also important but most of the time it ends up running over because more often  then not you get a customer who's call can easily last 25-30 mins or more. That along with management that are sometimes competent to what there doing to having no clue and learning with you. Favoritism is very strong with management, and if buttering them is what it takes to move up then this may not be the company for you. Also it fringes on cult like behavior which if you are already apart of the apple ecosystem or can buy the hype then this is the place for you. If not don't bother if this is not your-more...",3.0

I hold dual citizenship (USA/Mexico) and I had been approved to work remotely as a contractor. However, living in a border town in Texas, I do have to travel to Mexico pretty often to visit/take care of elderly parents who decided to live in Mexico due to elevated health care costs in the US. When I brought this up, it was unfortunate to learn that it was completely forbidden to work from any other location that was not my address in Texas (not even any other US city if I ever had to travel). So putting family first, as I think we all have learned to value more during this pandemic, I chose to skip this opportunity.I have been working in the tech industry for a while now and I completely understand how important security is. That being said, I hope that in the future Apple listens to the demands of employees and contractors in term of working remotely and can come up with further security measures (if the ones in place are not enough) to lessen corporate espionage paranoia.When it comes to linguists who are native speakers of a language other than American English, the private sector (and the government) ought to understand that it is unreasonable for them to expect those same linguists-more...",1.0

As a contractor, you won't be entitled to nearly anything, all of Apple's major perks go to Apple Employees and they make sure you know it.Your coworkers will be interesting, simply because of the international scale of the operation run in the Maps department there will be people from around the world who all have interesting stories to share, but that's where the positives end.As I worked the night shift, it is impossible to understate the difference between the night and day side of things. Because the principal boss and hiring manager for any promotions works almost exclusively during the day, you'll never see her. Since you'll never see her, she'll never know how hard you work so there is almost no chance of promotion. The upside is that it means the supervisors aren't watching you like a hawk in hopes of brown-nosing the Principal, however the downside is that you are essentially dead ended in this position.If you're looking for a job that lets you earn a decent wage while waiting to go to graduate school or looking for an actual career, it's fine.

Overall, I would say that it's a good company to build and advance your career. The company has excellent pay and benefits once you've gotten to a senior level position.The sales side of the company is extremely competitive and tends to lean more on the unethical and questionable side. You'll spend more time competing with other sales teams for Oracle products than actually competing with external forces. The comp structure on the sales side is crazy, but don't don't expect a solid base pay. Currently there is excessive pressure to push cloud services and cloud credits on customers. If you fight for your customer's best interests, you may get into trouble, so be careful.The consulting side of the company is extremely understaffed, under trained, and stretched very thin. The higher up you climb in the consulting side, you more customers and products you'll have to cover. You'll spend most of your time either in pre-sales consulting support or post-sales janitor duty. A lot of consulting gigs at Oracle are horribly mismanaged and at the behest of the sales team to clean up after their poor judgement on solution positioning or on the customers dime to fix their mistakes.The software development side can be challenging or fun, depending on which products you work on.

The initial training is completely substandard here unless you luck into a mentor that's willing to train you further. They offer decent wages but raises rarely happen and there's substantial turnover due to outsourcing and constant temp replacement. Advancement is mainly about office politics and the people you know higher up on the chain. People are fairly nice but there's was a bit too much clique-like behavior for my taste and far too much gossip as well. There's a saying here that's delivered sarcastically that you will most assuredly hear when you first arrive and bump into the first of what will be many frustrations: ""Welcome to Oracle"".On the bright side, they are a well known company, offer great benefits and the ability to move within the company is fairly easy once you're an employee.",3.0

Salesforce is probably one of the best employers in the world when you factor in your hourly wage instead of your annual wage. You'll work hard here but you won't be overworked.I will say that the biggest downside is executive alignment.

This is the least political and most supportive of any company for which I've worked.  Everyone is helpful and focused on collective success.  As diverse as the product spectrum may be, there are no silos that can't be crossed.  I regularly reach out to people I've never even met and I'm always greeted with a positive, 'how can I help' response.All of that being said, no company is worth working for if you don't respect the people you work with and feel that you are working with the best of the best.

I came onto a team that previously had a long rep sheet of attrition. With all the attrition, comes a lot of lost ""tribal knowledge"", which makes it more difficult for a developer to figure things out.  During the 2 years of working with the team I was on, my work was focused on fixing bugs and keeping the system afloat for a particular product. The customer use and adoption of the product grew significantly while the team members and management became more fragmented. A team of 8 engineers quickly became a team of 3 in the span of 6 months. As one of the 3 remaining, we were expected to keep up the work volume with less head count. It quickly became a big stress ball and I made my exit from the company.Management is spread too thin across teams and becomes disassociated with what is actually happening on the ground level.

Every day I work with companies using Salesforce to transform the way they do business. As the company expands, my opportunities do as well. Since working at Salesforce I have gained new skills that opened up new doors should I ever leave. There are also growing opportunities internally. Along with promotions, I have also been encouraged to move laterally at times to gain new experience.Along with career growth, I also appreciate the way Salesforce treats employees. My salary has always felt competitive with the industry average. The employee stock program has been a great way to create a stronger financial foundation. I have also been allowed to change my work location when needed, including opportunities to work remote. Remote work is dependent on the role.The downside to hyper growth has been the disruption internally. I don't mind change, but sometimes change happens without understanding the downstream impacts. I have seen executives overlook two separate organizations creating duplicate products and processes. I have also seen the opposite, when an executive team combined multiple groups without realizing what would be lost. In one example, a group was disassembled, only to be reassembled from the ground up later by a different team. Not only was it inefficient, it also brought resentment from the people who were initially required to move.Another concerning trend is a move to have each employee only do one type of task.

It's also super easy for me as an employee to get that match and log VTO time. Salesforce is setting the bar in this space along with Patagonia.

This allows people to find the right fit and better growth opportunities instead of needing to switch companies, but also surfaces problem with leadership on teams if a particular team has too much turnover.

Your first 3 months will be trying to make sense of it and feeling frustrated, until it eventually clicks that ""the rules are made up and the points don't matter"" (like Whose Line). Salesforce is approaching 40,000 employees but in many ways has retained that ""start-uppy"" feel of pivoting on a dime to build and release products sourced right from customer needs.It gives you whiplash early on, and everyone is constantly asked to do 200% of whatever they could possibly do (which is why the ""80-20 rule"" matters so much for work-life balance and mental health here). Eventually you learn to kind of shrug, say ""Whee!"", and go with it. Then it's fun! Learn to prioritize and advocate! Don't say ""Yes"" to everything, because the job will take everything from you it can if you let it, when we're going this fast.One of the coolest things about working here (a bug or a feature depending on you), is how openly the company wears its socially progressive stance on its sleeve. Philanthropy and pursuit of equality permeates the entire place's DNA, which infuses a sense of ""purpose"" into what could otherwise be cold or boring enterprise cloud software.Other recruiters have attempted to poach me multiple times and often told me how ""impossible"" it is to get people to leave Salesforce. The high compensation and sense of purpose is a huge part of why.Go to Dreamforce and see for yourself! Customers are RABID for this platform, they love it.

These are valuable things that may be new to most software developers, such as mindfulness, well-being, empathy.The struggle is knowing how to balance those values in a productive, fast-based industry.  This struggle can be even more difficult if management and leadership are not on board with the company values.  Some managers are focused too much on unrealistic end-results; they can't be bothered to think about whether or not their team members are finding meaning in their jobs or whether the company is giving back to its surrounding community.  These leaders fall back on old styles of management and promote a culture of shame.That being said, employees are empowered to seek out the proper role and team.

While recently Intel has made efforts to have dedicated night shift engineers to help with the work-load, any major issues are still relayed to process engineers. Depending on manager and team size, experiences can differ in terms of the weekend/holiday on-call rotation. I have had on-call rotation that was every six weeks to every two weeks (horrible). While senior engineers are helpful in learning new tasks and managers have laid out a decent idea of what improvements I need to make, I have been left to figure out my own way of how and where to learn whereas I prefer a structured learning process.

When I went to Intel I was hoping to find a career. I've been contracting a lot and wanted to settle into something permanent. That did not happen. Intel expects every engineer to dedicate their life to the company. Also, they claim they want honest feedback and aren't shy about expressing a frank opinion. This is not true.In the book 1984, George Orwell described the four ministries as having the exact opposite meaning as their titles ( Love, Peace, Plenty, and Truth). Intel's slogan at the time was ""Great Place to Work"". While most company slogans are just noise at Intel they managed to take this to Orwellian extremes. It should have said ""Worst Place to Work. Ever."". My experience there leads me to say it is truly an Orwellian Dystopia.I was expected to work at any time. I had regular meetings that started at 9PM. I regularly took meetings at 2AM. This was while maintaining a normal 8am to 5pm schedule. I was told point blank that perception of the group was more important than engineering ability.Granted, I am terrible at company politics (as are many engineers). At Intel if you can't (or won't) play the game, you won't do well no matter how good an engineer you are. At the time, they were clearing out engineers over 50 years of age (reduce insurance costs I think). I made that easy for them with my honesty.

You can learn a lot from working with many professionals, but you have to take the initiative to learn the skills you want. Sometimes, when there's too much flexibility or open-ness, you kind of get complacent with how you grow.Intel does offer a lot of courses and resources to get you the training you need, but you'll have to initiate finding how to learn those skills and then kind of wait for the opportunity to use them. I personally work better in companies, where you constantly wear multiple hats, and are forced into many different technologies - you get to learn quickly and get hands-on experiences! So, I left Intel to get into a faster paced environment.

Its always possible to save money. If you are transfered to the wrong team or fall ill and have a poor focal you can get laid off. They have really come up with innovative ways to cut US heads and now are doing it in other countries. You will work at least 50 hours a week but you'll have options to move to new teams and learn new tech. I recommend you only stay in a job for 3 years then keep moving. Its the only way to move up unless you are patient. If you are a good worker they won't do good promos because they want you to stay in the same role. This company has peaked as far as stock price so the stock grants aren't close to what they used to be. I would recommend working for another tech firm if you are an IT pro. This is not an IT company. They are centered around manufacturing. If they can save money by cutting IT heads they will. the CEO is always trying to get the stock price up and the only way they can really get increased revenue is by cutting heads, at least that's what they seem to think. Salary seems to start low but raises are decent each year. They keep cutting the bonus program and there's no more on call pay so it took me till year 7 to make as much as I was when i was on call years 1-3. Still I did enjoy my time there but I was very sick for 9 months and took MLOA. I had a very avg focal but that was to be expected. Next year they said anyone with low stock grants were laid off and with that I was gone after 15 years. Don't get sick if you work there! I'm not bitter as I'm-more...",3.0

It's not nice nor is is conducive to a team environment and a cohesive working relationship as I was always made to feel less than the Blue Badge/Full Time employee's when my work was just as good if not better as I went the extra mile when a lot of times the FTE would just ""phone it in"" and not give it that extra effort.It is a very toxic culture to people who are just trying to make a living and weren't lucky enough to get a Full Time Intel position.I could not reccomend this company.

Constant re-organizations and shuffling people around can derail your career in a hurry with a single negative review. Tricky to navigate.Diversity culture is taken to an extreme and if you are not diverse accepting you will face considerable pressure and probably be forced out.Incompetence is promoted regularly and this is clearly seen in many of the VP's and upper management. Including mandatory attendance to useless meetings and bad money management. Budgets can be tight while millions are spend on useless consulting or contract agreements with external vendors.Internal IT support is good, but also disproportionately awarded bonuses for things like 'rolling out new SW' vs. component design 'rolling out a new CPU'.

However upper management doesn't seem to have the patience to wait for the outcome. Each time Intel spends millions of dollars to buy a new startup and then cancels it after few years. Same thing goes with products. In my previous team 3 projects in our department got cancelled in a year. It's a waste of resources and big tank on morale.Furthermore other companies like Google, Facebook, Alibaba and Apple are making their own chip and are heavily recruiting people (from Intel). However Intel doesn't match the compensation from these companies, so attrition rate has become a pretty big issue recently.The good part of being a big company is it is rather easy to move around the company to different job functions. I know a lot of people switched from backend to frontend to architect, from engineer switched to marketing or data science.

Groups I've typically worked in for Intel employ some form of Agile development, and as such, you get to be a software developer, software validation, and automation engineer at any point. While it can be demanding, this GREATLY increases your overall useful skillset and has helped me immensely in my professional career. The hardest part of the job is that sometimes there are some VERY demanding schedules, but you get paid back on the other end with recognition and having easier weeks/months as well. My co-workers are some of the brightest minds in their respective fields and getting to work closely with some of Intel's Fellows and Senior Fellows was its own reward. Management can swing wildly however between the two different styles of groups. Money making groups tend to have happier employees and plenty of budget to make work fun. As such, management in these groups attracts the best managers available. On the other hand, money ""saving"" groups, or groups that only look to make certain parts of Intel process more efficient tend to have low turn over rates and higher job security at the cost of deeply unrewarding work. These type of groups tend to foster a mistrust of your co-workers as everyone is directly in contention for promotions and good reviews. On the other side, the money making groups tend to take the approach of ""a rising tide raises all ships"", so if they group does well, everyone in it tends to WANT to do well and works hard-more...",5.0

They can make you on a great career path, or you can be left to the wolves. Intel lays off a lot of people each year in the annual review process. ""They hire the best"" but they also layoff a certain percentage (target) in the annual review. Its not terribly hard to beat the odds and not be the one let go. However you have to play the game, and not be the one that gets picked for sacrifice. Since they did away with the pension benefit several years ago and reduce the profit sharing percentage the compensation has gone down a little bit.I've worked at Intel twice, both times were excellent until mgmt changed and then it wasn't great. So if you are interviewing really think hard if you would 'like' to be with the manager weather the message is good or bad. Also, look out for behavioral interviewing, its been part of training in the past, i think its not worth the time, but it occurs. Also, as someone who opened a REQ in the past to hire someone, please be upfront about your VISA stations/right to work in the USA.

This guy was so self non-confident and poor communicator that it was very hard to discuss or resolve issues with him . Probably that explained his insecurity also since he never liked people even casually talking to his manager or other superiors .the work culture is very demotivating , late nights , early mornings , weekend calls and no acknowledgement or appreciation for all that .Cisco Engineering is probably one of the special orgs which has got sooooo maaaaany Project Managers and still almost all of the projects are  mostly yellow or red in reality . As a matter of fact they are mostly painted green to management and leadership in manual PPTs or XLSs .It is also one of the rare orgs where people have been overstaying for 10+ , 15+ and even 20+ years mostly because of political contacts and scratching each others' backs .",1.0

I have to say, I get to call the shots when it comes to my work environment. When Cisco started tearing down cubicles in lieu of open workspaces, I could no longer concentrate and moved off campus (worked from home). I've enjoyed not having to go out of the house to get to work and Cisco provides me with equipment to teleconference instead.My only real dissatisfaction element is that of promotion. I've received few, where I know others have received many more. Is it just because I wanted to keep doing what I was doing at Cisco? Everyone I talk to says I do a great job, but I never seem to get that recognition in the form of a promotion or pay rise. It has been the most discouraging thing.Compensation remaining the same, benefits have been costing more. Health insurance climbs for everyone year over year. Benefits drop by the wayside; small ones to be sure, but drop they do. No more stock options. No more restricted stock grants. We still get bonuses, but they're not a lot.There are some benefits that remain strong. Cisco give me a phone, router, and laptop to work from home or anywhere. I have a choice of laptops. They're good technology all: when new equipment becomes the norm, Cisco upgrades our old equipment. They no longer help us pay for Internet access; that used to be a perk. We no longer get help with paying for a mobile; that, too, used to be a perk.All in all, Cisco pays the bills. I don't have much more time to work, so I'm happy to have /a/ job.

The work/life balance is great for parents, and there is virtually zero pressure to complete work on-time or ""correctly."" Since the culture of the company skews older, many managers are empathetic to last-minute PTO requests, and extensions on deadlines are always viable. This means that there is no expectation to ""crunch,"" which can be a great relief to anyone who's about to burnout from the fast-paced software industry.Unfortunately, these cultural values come at a cost. The company operates at a painfully slow pace, as there is no incentive to address issues as they arise. Sometimes the engineer that is blocking you is on PTO for a week or is a contractor overseas that only answers emails 9-5, their time. This becomes exasperated when you must navigate across more than four separate employees for access to basic tools/technology/documentation, a common issue with large companies.Budding, young developers should beware.

They will take months to follow up, only to tell you that the vacancy has already been filled. I passed their coding challenge and then proceeded to talk to a team member in Virginia. It was non-technical and the only reason why he did it was that he was the only one in the office for that Friday. That was it, nothing more past that. Maybe he wanted to talk about sports, or maybe it's a racial issue (I am Latino, and Virginia is known for its dark racial history e.g. just see their current governor).After this non-fiasco of a nothingburger, I myself applied in Texas months later, and was contacted again but right before I was about to do the coding challenge I was told I was not able to proceed any further due to the ""results"" of my previous coding challenge (I passed the coding challenge of my previous interview, it's how I was able to talk to one team member in Virginia in the first place).That's when I knew the recruiters were lying.

It's frustrating for a team to try and work hard and then have someone on your team who does the bare minimum or nothing at all.I'm all for the Agile process, but having two - three hour meetings every single day is just too much. They are so mired down in process. It's a wonder any real work gets done.

Managers are required to give a certain number of each level of performance rating (needs intervention, strong, very strong, excellent). The bottom 10% of employees will be FIRED.  Turnover rate is very high (that doesn't even include the massive layoffs every few years.)Your ability to get promoted or keep your job is based on your manager's ability to argue for you as well as how much your manager likes you(wants to argue for you.)  This means every time you help another employee succeed you are directly contributing to your own inability to get promoted or keep your own job.  This system is evil.As a result, the best method for advancement is to make other people's failures as public as possible while trying to publicly prove you have accomplished something.  Showing you are good at something is far more important that actually doing it, being good at it, or caring about what you're doing.  Good people become cut throat and vicious.Real teamwork is non-existent.  Instead what you get are people working closely with other with the intention of throwing them under the bus.  The metaphorical ""crabs in a box"".Additionally, tons of good people get fired because someone had to be fired.

As a result, Quality Assurance specialists have been eliminated and developers are testing their own code and the code of their peers, like 50 years ago before Software QA was born. Quality is deteriorating as a result. Every developer is expected to also be an expert on Amazon Web Services, several computer languages and Devops, but the peer support in this endeavor is lacking.Managers are hands off, which can be a good thing except that managerial guidance has been replaced by bullying and nepotism. Also, when large projects come down, there was never any project manager to make it happen - it was just a directive that ""you worker bees make it happen."" The worker bees are solid and they usually deliver, but not with the degree of detail and level of quality that happens when there is a single person managing the project. That is, not all the i's get dotted.""Lunch"" is a weird thing. Some teams get a lunch served every day. Other teams get none.

I toyed with the idea of going back, but truly didn't want to be in that position again.

They sought me out as a Friend of IBM because I was the original designer of the Softlayer network (Network Product Specialist who sold all network gear to build Softlayer from Day 1). Very bright and talented managers and directors at IBM, super friendly and easy to work with. At the time, challenges were mostly around moving faster to compete with AWS and others. So much of IBM embraces open source but IBM Cloud was still getting used to it. My assessment was that IBM used COTS firewalls on every deal which tacked on $10K per month for each customer. AWS used open source so they incurred no expense for firewalls. Since IBM has so many banking and insurance customers, they were not trusting open source firewalls. We sold VMware NSX to all VMware on IBM Cloud customers so that should have been the firewall but IBM really wanted to front-end that with a hardware Fortinet firewall. I was not happy with this but understood their position on it. Since the outer firewalls all had the same access lists, I submitted a design to run them in layer 2 and put multiple customers behind each Fortinet. I needed my NSX to own the outside IP ranges.

I was oftentimes pushed to travel to client sites for even just a few days. It was fun the first few times, but after some time it was a waste of time, energy, and money.

IBM is the epitome of bureaucracy. There are literally tens of thousands of managers and presidents here.

He would come into the office to ""work"" from 11 am to around 2 pm, then call it a day. Not kidding here. We had four departmental meetings over the course of five years... his work consisted of hosting monthly one-on-ones and giving generic one-liners in our quarterly assessments that included things like, ""Making good progress"", and ""Continue to learn about the Cloud"". Why IBM is paying a manager six figures to do what any functional adult could do is beyond me.Because my manager knew so little about the work my team did, he frequently mis-hired people, which only added to our collective workload. At one point, he hired a contractor who couldn't grasp basic computer concepts (I thought this was a tech company?). After six months of agony, he finally acquiesced to the team's demands and let her go.Recently, the company underwent another ""restructuring"" and guess who survived the large-scale layoff?

I am not personally into 100% travel and some of these projects are that. Though, I've found it difficult at times to work remotely depending on time zones. They will not switch projects for most reasons aside from health. They will encourage advancement if they see you're doing well and will give you a small raise.

The benefits for the worker bees is not really even the best (I'm sure the VP and up level has platinum-plated goodies), and the amount of bureaucracy and inertia can be difficult to master or work with if you are someone who actually expects to achieve something.As to market placement or strategy?  It changes each fiscal half (which, strangely enough, is how your performance is judged...every 6 months).  It was CAMSS, then Security Intelligence, then Cloud First, then Red Hat (I pity those folks after they've been 'blue washed' by their new corporate masters) then...who knows?  But whatever it is, it will not be leading edge, the most economical, or even what the market wants.  The time for IBM calling the shots and defining the playing field is LONG past.  They are in reactive, not initiative, mode.While I've enjoyed the folks I've worked with here, and certainly there is a certain cachet of having IBM on your resume...if you've initiative (and are under 40), a keen sense of integrity, and looking for a long-term career without having to suck up to the next step in the chain so your name doesn't pop up on-more...",1.0

Essentially, you will be asked to take several weeks a year off as furlough in order for management to maintain the appearance of positive growth to the stockholders.Nothing sucks more than getting a 6 week furlough notice in November and losing over a month and half worth of pay during the Holiday season... just so the incapable upper and mid level management can retain their bonuses for the Holidays.Do not think for one minute that IBM cares about you as a person. I worked for this company for almost a decade and not once were the contractual commitments met.On the plus side, they are so disorganized that they pay an excessive amount of time for folks to be sitting around and waiting for other towers to deliver something, so there is plenty of time to educate yourself, build skills and explore other career opportunities.If you are into the ""hurry up and wait"" culture, where you spend most of your lifetime on conference calls listening to ineptitude, then this is the perfect company for you! The performance bar has been set so low by all of the off-shore contractors, that it is easy enough to distinguish yourself simply by being able to read and write fluent English and attending the 4-5 hours of conference calls per day.If you like the challenges of having no direction, no support from your management or co-workers and plenty of free time, this is PERFECT!",1.0

As IBM tries to undergo a transformation to a more forward thinking company there are a lot of growing pains and most of these things are side effects. I think ultimately IBM will get through this and it could be a good place to work in the long term.

The push is on money not quality. Estimates for projects are generally below what is needed to keep costs down. This results in unpaid overtime to meet estimates. No matter how good you are, well-liked by clients (who even send emails to managers) and co-workers, if budgets are cut contractors are let go first (furloughed).

However, unless you get a very high rating during the annual review your pay increase will be small or none. There is a lot of very smart people there and it is very hard to get the best rating unless your manager really like you. That is unfortunate because you can have an entire department that is very smart and it comes down to a judgement call in terms of who gets a higher rating. The culture in general is good.

IBM did not invest in the future of our product.  No new money was spent on features, technology or training.  Our Windows desktop application never implemented multi-core processing, a web-based UI, a mobile platform, or any cloud-based technologies.  At least once a year, our department (less than 10 people) was downsized by a full person.  I don't know what IBM gets out of acquiring technology that they don't support in any meaningful way.

Yes, I know that's not a good idea, but that type of stuff comes up with friends eventually. The two men were almost identical in salary, while I make HALF of what they do. I have more experience than both. I tried to bring this up with every manager I have had and everyone just said ""Sorry, should have done better negotiating."" It's simply unacceptable. To be clear, as far as metrics went, and metrics are the be-all and end-all of judgment, I was always in the top 3-4 people in performance out of a team of 20.I will say that my management did not micromanage, but they also did not praise any behavior. I have also had it where managers did not share with me that I needed to improve at work until I specifically asked for feedback. While I don't like to be micromanaged, I do like to feel that I am noticed and cared for. Also, we didn't have any level of training in the last few years that I was there. Too many corners cut, and not investing enough back into the employees that have been loyal for so long.The work/life balance was mostly great.

IBM started sliding from ""great"" to ""good"" during Sam Palmisano's latter years at the helm, when leadership seemed obsessed with demonstrating profitability through cost savings by greatly curtailing the march to innovation. I was a product manager at that time and witnessed the preference of acquisition over organic innovation, to reduce risks and, perhaps, to mitigate the impact of the inertia that sets in when people get ""a little too comfortable"" about their position in the organization and their organization's position in the market... Over the past two years, I am seeing more invigoration, organizational agility and investment in the pursuit of innovation. The current leadership, under Ginny Rommety, seems to be true to their message. It takes a while to turn a battleship, but battleships can certainly be turned.When I joined the company, my favorite aspect was the opportunity to take on new and challenging roles. This enabled me to grow as a professional at an accelerated rate and gain work experience in a enough capacities that I was once told that my resume was ""all over the place"". Okay, that may have been a not-so-greatly written resume on my part. The point is that the environment at IBM enabled me to stretch and become more well-rounded than I believe would have been the case in most other environments.The downside is that I still run into some of the behaviors that, IMO, result when some people are seeking comfort and job security without a focus on COMPETING.

Also, the company doesn't invest what is needed to make most business lines successful, either in development staff or marketing funding.Very bureaucratic, lots of layers of approvals to get things done. And internal tools and systems are decades old and incredibly inefficient. But IBM won't even use most of it's own modern products internally in place of old legacy systems because ""it would be too expensive"" - yes, I was actually told this - and yet IBM pushes these too expensive products onto customers... CRAZY!Bonuses are minimal if not non-existent (think $1000 or less for the year) for non-executives. And the company doesn't give out stock or options to hardly anyone. So there's really no upside for non-executive employees.The board and executives run the company like an old line manufacturing company in a low-growth or stagnant industry.

Work/Life balance is still good, however that is steadily declining like many other personable benefits once enjoyed 10+ years ago. Positives include ample opportunity to gain skills and experience with latest technology, and in creating leading-edge technology and solutions.Low-level management is, on average, very good, personable, and willing to work with you and make your work experience enjoyable. They're not given much resource (money, time, etc.) to make that happen, though, nor are they given money for travel and education needs for their employees. Employees are required to find free options either inside IBM or externally.High-levels of management are, on average, decently prepared to share strategic vision and strategies. They tend to be overly resistant to delegate authority, so you have to get used to a fairly slow decision making process.Building and facilities are average. Basic, traditional office spaces.

I had about 5 managers who had no idea what was going on with me, nor did they appear to care whatsoever. It reminded me of the movie ""Office Space"" with numerous bosses and meetings that held no real value for productivity or advancement. I also discovered that IBM was charging customers as if we were ""level 7 programmers"", but paying us as ""level 3 programmers"".... which seams almost criminal.Overall I feel that IBMs goal is to soak up money with no regard to the product they are returning to the customers, or to the economy.

There is no budget for managers to motivate their teams. Raises and promotions are far and in between. The appraisal system is tied to the budget, so if the budget is small, employees are given poor appraisals even though they don't deserve them. The politics are horrible. Top performers leave because they are not appreciated, and everyone else is eventually let go. The only people that seem to be happy are those who take assignments in the growth market countries. IBM's strategy is to build over in these countries, and US employees willing to go over and get shops set up seem to be rewarded handsomely. The only good thing left for US employees is the flexibility.

A lot of chaotic changes happened just so that someone can have a great performance evaluation to jump to another team after which the project is forgotten (I've seen it happen many times). It's amazing how many resources are wasted for meaningless work. It's sad to see engineers taking over management tasks from incompetent managers just to get work done.For the cultural part, don't be fooled - it's not the same open and inclusive company as it used to be. People get fired for saying the ugly truth. The hierarchy is much more enforced than it used to be (in my org tree). Make sure you work there as a full-time employee (FTE) and not let's say a contractor.

I did have the knowledge of how big enterprises work, but Amazon was a completely new experience. I learnt there from day 1. And for a customer centric organization like Amazon, Software skills are as much important as their leadership principles.A typical day in Amazon, as my team was working using Agile Methodology, would be start of the day with some tasks and as the team arrives we had the daily scrum. Everyone will talk about their tasks performed the previous day, the tasks they're focussing currently and/or any roadblocks. A I was interning I had been assigned a mentor who would guide me more often than not regarding the direction to follow. Spring MVC was a new thing for me back then so we started with basics and gradually moved to project implementation. My project was around Alexa hence along with Java Spring MVC I had to work with Alexa's programming as well.We had Sprint Planning every two weeks where we discussed the next two weeks plan. Workplace culture in Amazon differed from team to team and I think my team's workplace culture was pretty helpful. The team consisted of very knowledgeable people and hence I learnt a lot from them. The hardest part of job was to imbibe the leadership principles in every day work. It is something which needs to come from within and not something you can train yourself to do and hence I would consider it as the hardest part. Software wise speaking understanding the current implementation and working my way out for my use cases was exciting part. All SDEs are required-more...",4.0

You can survive in it and contribute to it, but you have to scramble around constantly to keep out of the way of its moving parts. It's amusing to think that so many experts are terrified of the notion of hostile Artificial Intelligence, when we've already generated semi-intelligent virtual organisms like Amazon that are totally ruthless and uncaring of human life.Amazon is not a place to work if you value independence. Amazon is not a place to work if you dislike office politics. Amazon is not a place to work if you're a technical person who likes the technical aspects of the job but who doesn't enjoy meetings, paperwork (in online forms, of course), and endless red tape.

This leads to coworker back-biting around performance review time, and best-of-luck if your manager doesn’t like you. It’s a big company with a high burnout rate. They offer pool tables and foosball tables in buildings, yet nobody has time to play! Brilliant people work at intel, so smart people will love being burnt-out there, and can commiserate and drink away their complaints during the drunken team-builders.

To the point, where I am currently on a severely understaffed team with no option to backfill the roles for people who have been leaving.When I had a good manager, they found ways to balance all of this without putting too much on the engineers.  With the bad managers, it all ends up with pushing the engineers until many start looking for new jobs.As for why it depends on department, when working in factory training was great and well documented.

Unfortunately, the company has lost it's way in finding new ways to replace declining revenue streams in their traditional businesses (hardware, software, services). They have missed several paradigm shifts in the industry and have been playing catch up (cloud services is the most recent example) for many years. The financial results reported over a fair amount of time have been the result of selling off of lines of business, selling real estate, layoffs and reducing the cost of labor by moving jobs to offshore locations. Revenue has been flat or down for many, many quarters.As a place to work, it was great most of the time. Very knowledgeable employees, I learned a great deal, and there were great education/training tools available for those that wanted to take advantage of them. Benefits were good but like everywhere else, more of the health care coverage costs were being shifted to the employee. Work/life balance depended on what job role you were in.  Due to the declining revenue issues, all parts of the business were affected by the need to do more with less (meaning fewer workers, more work). By far the worst area I ever worked in was Finance. Really long hours and a constant maniacal drive to cut cost and expense year after year.Overall, a good place to get a start for young college graduates.

I figured an entry-level position would place me around the same loveable geeks and nerds that I had just graduated a CS Major with; it did not. IBM is for the Type-A, ambitious, hard-worker that never clocks out.  If you're single, with no kids, and no life at all - you could do well here.  For the career minded individual they offer competitive pay, plenty of paths for advancement, education reimbursement, and decent benefits.  The down-side is you have 3+ bosses and you never clock out.Be prepared to meet with India at 2AM, be on again for scrum at 8am, and have them ask you what work you've done since you last spoke (like you don't ever need to sleep). Be prepared for your manager to track you down while you're on vacation because no one else could possibly explain proper configuration to a client. Be prepared to get a less than satisfactory review, even if all your completed work was rated as above satisfactory, because new patents and innovations are still expected while you're working 80h weeks to turn in all deliverable code, tests, and documentation for your assigned stories.If you're a career-minded shark in a business suit, you'll do well here.
